# SUCCESs Framework Deep Dive

A comprehensive reference for each principle from "Made to Stick" by Chip and Dan Heath.

## Principle 1: SIMPLE

### Core Concept

Simplicity isn't about dumbing down—it's about finding the core of your idea and expressing it compactly. The goal is **core + compact**: both simple AND profound.

> "If you say three things, you don't say anything."

### The Problem

- **Burying the lead**: Starting with background instead of the point
- **Decision paralysis**: Too many options = no action
- **Sound bites vs. proverbs**: Short isn't the goal; profound AND short is

### Key Techniques

**Commander's Intent (CI)**
The military's solution to plans failing on contact with the enemy. CI states the single most important outcome. If everything else fails, what must happen?

Example: "THE low-fare airline" (Southwest Airlines) - Every decision filters through this.

**Core + Compact**
1. Find the single most important thing
2. Express it as compactly as possible
3. Make it profound enough to guide behavior

Example: "It's the economy, stupid" (Clinton campaign)

**The Inverted Pyramid**
Lead with the most important information. Assume readers may stop at any point.

**High-Concept Pitches**
Describe the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar.
- "Jaws on a spaceship" = Alien
- "Die Hard on a bus" = Speed

**Generative Analogies**
Analogies that continue to generate new ideas and behaviors.
- Disney "cast members" → affects dress, behavior, interactions
- Palm Pilot "wood block" → if it doesn't fit in pocket, redesign

### Diagnostic Questions

- If readers remember only one thing, what should it be?
- What would the Commander's Intent be?
- Could this idea guide behavior for years?
- What can be cut while preserving the core?

## Principle 2: UNEXPECTED

### Core Concept

Get attention with surprise, hold attention with interest. Surprise comes from breaking patterns; interest comes from creating and filling knowledge gaps.

### The Problem

- **Gimmicky surprise**: Surprises that don't serve the message
- **The guessing machine**: Our brains constantly predict; we notice pattern breaks
- **Losing interest**: Surprise fades; you need sustained curiosity

### Key Techniques

**Break the Pattern**
Our brains run on prediction. Break the pattern to get attention.

Example: A flight safety announcement done as comedy—passengers actually listen.

**Postdictable Surprise**
The best surprises make sense in retrospect. They're not random—they shift your schema.

Example: Good movie twists feel inevitable once revealed.

**Curiosity Gap**
Open a gap in knowledge, then fill it. People feel compelled to close open loops.

How to create gaps:
1. Pose a question or puzzle
2. Create a mystery to be solved
3. Challenge assumptions
4. Reveal something unexpected about something familiar

Example: "What do you think has more saturated fat: a Big Mac or a bag of movie popcorn?"

**The Mystery Format**
Frame your communication as a mystery to be solved. Walk the audience through the investigation.

**Sustained Interest**
Move from surprise (attention) to interest (engagement) by:
- Creating context gaps before filling them
- Making them feel they're missing something they need
- Promising valuable answers

### Diagnostic Questions

- What's counterintuitive about this idea?
- What assumption can I violate?
- What knowledge gap can I open?
- Is the surprise serving the message or distracting from it?

## Principle 3: CONCRETE

### Core Concept

Ideas stick when they're sensory and tangible. Abstract language is the enemy of memorability. Concreteness makes ideas clear, memorable, and shareable.

### The Problem

- **The abstraction trap**: Experts naturally speak in abstractions
- **Ambiguity**: Abstract ideas mean different things to different people
- **Forgettability**: Abstract concepts don't stick in memory

### Key Techniques

**Sensory Language**
If you can't see it, hear it, feel it, taste it, or smell it, it's abstract.

Bad: "Reduce environmental impact"
Good: "Landscapes as eco-celebrities" (Concord, Crane Flat)

**The Velcro Theory of Memory**
More hooks = more memorable. Each concrete detail is a hook.

The Kidney Heist sticks because: ice-filled bathtub, cell phone by the tub, tube in the back, "DON'T MOVE" note.

**Concrete Goals**
Make targets visualizable and unambiguous.

Abstract: "Achieve operational excellence"
Concrete: "Put a man on the moon and return him safely by the end of the decade"

**The White Things Exercise**
Specific prompts beat general prompts. "White things in your refrigerator" produces more items than "white things."

**Schema Mapping**
Explain the unfamiliar by mapping to familiar schemas.

Example: A pomelo is like a grapefruit but larger and with a thicker rind.

### Diagnostic Questions

- Can someone picture this in their mind?
- Would two people interpret this the same way?
- What sensory details can I add?
- Am I using abstract language out of habit?

## Principle 4: CREDIBLE

### Core Concept

Ideas need to carry their own credentials. Without external authority, make ideas verifiable, demonstrate proof points, or let people test for themselves.

### The Problem

- **No built-in authority**: Most of us aren't surgeon generals or Nobel laureates
- **Statistics don't stick**: Numbers without context are meaningless
- **Skepticism**: People naturally question claims

### Key Techniques

**The Sinatra Test**
One example that proves everything. "If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."

Example: "If we can handle catering for the White House, we can handle your event."

**Antiauthority**
Sometimes credibility comes from experience, not credentials.

Example: Pam Laffin, a smoker dying of lung disease, was more credible than doctors on anti-smoking campaigns.

**Testable Credentials**
Let people verify for themselves.

Example: "Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago." (Reagan)

**Human-Scale Statistics**
Make numbers relatable by putting them in human terms.

Bad: "5,000 nuclear warheads"
Good: "Enough nuclear warheads to fill a bucket with BBs—and one BB can destroy a city"

**Vivid Details**
Specific details signal authenticity and truth.

Example: In a trial, mentioning the defendant's "Darth Vader toothbrush" made the whole testimony more believable—even though it was irrelevant.

**The "Where's the Beef?" Test**
Can your claims withstand challenge? What's the evidence?

### Diagnostic Questions

- Why should they believe this?
- What's my Sinatra Test?
- Can they verify this themselves?
- Are my statistics in human terms?

## Principle 5: EMOTIONAL

### Core Concept

Make people feel something. We're wired to feel for people, not abstractions. Connect to what they care about and who they are.

### The Problem

- **Semantic stretch**: Overused emotional words lose power ("unique" isn't unique)
- **Statistics kill feeling**: "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic"
- **Maslow's basement**: We assume others are motivated by base needs

### Key Techniques

**The Mother Teresa Principle**
"If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will."

Always find the individual. One starving child > statistics about famine.

**WIIFY: "What's In It For You"**
Don't bury the benefit. Lead with what matters to the audience.

Example: "Don't sell the drill; sell the hole."

**Appeal to Identity**
People make decisions based on who they are, not just what they want.

Example: "Don't Mess with Texas" appealed to Texan identity, not just anti-litter messaging.

**Avoid Maslow's Basement**
We think others are motivated by base needs (money, security) when they often care about higher needs (purpose, growth, esteem).

Example: Floyd Lee didn't run an Army mess tent; he ran "the best restaurant in Iraq." His cooks cared about morale, not just calories.

**Association**
Connect ideas to things people already feel strongly about.

**Creating Empathy**
Use specific details and perspective-taking to generate emotional connection.

### Diagnostic Questions

- What emotion should this evoke?
- Is there an individual I can highlight?
- Am I appealing to their identity?
- Am I assuming base motivations when higher ones exist?

## Principle 6: STORIES

### Core Concept

Stories are mental flight simulators. They prepare us to act by letting us rehearse situations vicariously. Good stories make people see themselves in the narrative.

### The Problem

- **Telling instead of showing**: Facts inform; stories inspire action
- **Missing the natural story**: Sticky stories often exist—we just miss them
- **Wrong story type**: Different plots serve different purposes

### The Three Basic Plots

**The Challenge Plot**
Protagonist overcomes obstacles through perseverance.
- Creates determination and courage
- "David vs. Goliath," "Rags to Riches"

Example: Jared losing 245 pounds eating Subway sandwiches.

**The Connection Plot**
Relationship bridges a gap (racial, class, belief).
- Creates social connection and empathy
- "Good Samaritan," "Romeo and Juliet"

Example: Stories of unlikely friendships across divides.

**The Creativity Plot**
Mental breakthrough solves a puzzle.
- Creates inspiration to think differently
- "Eureka moment," "MacGyver"

Example: Newton and the apple.

### Key Techniques

**Spotting Stories**
The best stories are often already there—you just need to notice them.

Example: Subway executives initially rejected the Jared story. A local franchisee spotted its potential.

**Springboard Stories**
Short stories that help audiences see possibilities for themselves.

Example: "In Zambia, a health worker..." stories at the World Bank that helped people envision knowledge-sharing possibilities.

**Mental Simulation**
Stories that let people rehearse actions improve actual performance.

Example: Firefighters swapping stories after fires multiply their experience.

### Diagnostic Questions

- Is there a person going through something here?
- Which plot type serves my purpose? (Challenge, Connection, or Creativity)
- Does this story let the audience see themselves?
- What action should the story inspire?

## Using the Framework

### Quick Application

1. **Start with Simple**: Find your Commander's Intent
2. **Add Unexpected**: What pattern can you break?
3. **Make it Concrete**: Replace every abstraction with something visual
4. **Build Credibility**: What's your Sinatra Test?
5. **Add Emotion**: Find the individual, appeal to identity
6. **Tell a Story**: Who is the protagonist? What do they overcome?

### Scoring Your Ideas

For each principle, ask: On a scale of 1-5, how well does this idea embody this principle?

- 1: Not present
- 3: Present but weak
- 5: Strong and memorable

Aim for at least one 5 and no 1s.

### The Ultimate Test

Tell your idea to someone. Wait an hour. Ask them to tell it back to you.

If they can retell it accurately with the important details intact, it's sticky.
